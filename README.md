# Hey, I'm Chris

I build small, focused desktop utilities that solve real problems.

## Apps

### [Janitor](https://github.com/made-by-chris/janitor)
**Clean your keyboard & mouse without accidental inputs.**
Blocks all input for 30 seconds so you can wipe down your peripherals. Features an on-screen keyboard tracker that shows which keys you've cleaned, mouse button tracking, and a "keep going" mode for thorough cleaning sessions. Windows & macOS.

### [Pointful](https://github.com/made-by-chris/pointful)
**Screen grid overlay for online teaching.**
Helps teachers communicate precise screen locations to students by overlaying a chess-style coordinate grid (A1, B2, etc.) with sub-quadrants. Toggle with Ctrl+Alt+G. Click-through overlay so students can interact normally. Windows & macOS.

### [NightShift](https://github.com/made-by-chris/NightShift)
**Turn off your monitors while AI agents work overnight.**
Keeps your machine awake while letting your monitors sleep. Perfect for running Claude Code, Cowork, OpenClaw, or other AI agents through the night without screen burn or wasted energy.

### [cc](https://github.com/made-by-chris/cc)
**Multi-slot clipboard manager for power users.**
A lightweight clipboard manager with multiple named slots for copying and pasting. Stop overwriting your clipboard every time you copy something new.

### [BoardKey](https://github.com/made-by-chris/boardkey)
**Universal keyboard shortcut translator.**
Press a shortcut, share the URL, and it translates to any keyboard layout and platform. No more confusion when sharing shortcuts between QWERTY, AZERTY, Dvorak, Mac, and Windows users.

All apps are built with [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/) for tiny bundle sizes (~5MB vs Electron's ~100MB+).
